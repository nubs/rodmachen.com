One year ago, I began a new journey. As the school year came to a close, this teacher began to look into what it would take to move into the world of tech. After a little research, it became clear that my course lay in web development. And with that, I started learning how to program. 

Up till now, it has mostly been self-teaching, with one part-time class focused on the front end. In August, all of that will change. I have accepted admission to the remote cohort of Hack Reactor, a San Francisco-based coding school.

From the beginning I knew I would attend a bootcamp of some sort. I started from zero, with no experience programming to speak of. (The failed attempts of my younger years are fodder for a separate piece.) The last year has seen my knowledge grow by leaps and bounds, from the ecosystem of web development, the languages used, and the community that comprises it. 

I first heard of Hack Reactor several months ago, and its reputation was excellent. The CTO, Marcus Phillips, has had my admiration since I first saw him teach on recordings of his JSConf seminars. The focus on JavaScript throughout the stack appealed to me the more I learned the language, and their rapid iteration teaching was impressive to someone who spends his days in a classroom (though for just a few more weeks.)

Earlier this year, Hack Reactor acquired MakerSquare, a local coding school that I saw as the most logical destination for me. At the time they were a Ruby on Rails school, so having them move to this JavaScript-heavy curriculum was win-win for me. 

In the end, I chose a different route. Last summer Hack Reactor debuted their Remote Beta program. It has all of the components of the onsite class but with the ability to be accessed from anywhere. This meshes nicely with my future goals. Since I first contemplated a career change, the idea of working remotely has been a dream of mine. After being prisoner to the time and place constraints of a public school classroom (filled with teenagers, no less!) I’ve longed for some freedom in my work. Remote employment would give me just that. 

At this point the most satisfying thing about my admission to Hack Reactor is finally knowing my near-future plans. I’ll continue to do my own exploration (currently of Node.js) but come July, I’ll be deep in the weeds of pre-course work for my class. Luckily, all of that must be done two weeks before the class starts, so I’ll get one last break before beginning what should prove to be the most educational three months of my life. Eleven-hour days six days a week won’t be easy, but I know I’ll leave the experience knowing a hundred times more about software engineering than I do right now.

Now back to the books.
