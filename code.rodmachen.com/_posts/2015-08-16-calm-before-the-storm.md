Tomorrow I begin an important step in my journey learning to code. Leaving the teaching profession for a career in software development has been a long time coming. A year ago, wrote my first line of code. Three months ago, I sent off my last class of high school seniors. Now, I become the student.

For the next three months, I’ll be a part of the remote cohort of [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/), a coding school based out of San Francisco that’s going to facilitate this somewhat-ambitious career transition. I’ve [written before](http://code.rodmachen.com/learning-to-code-hack-reactor/) about how I came to make this decision, but now, after months and months of preparation, it’s here.

This summer has not only been my last as a teacher, complete with taking care of my kids thoughout the week, but it’s also been filled with prep work for this course. I estimate I’ve spent the better part of 70 hours going over JavaScript fundamentals, boning up on Git(Hub), dipping my toe the waters of algorithms (recursion!!!), and even rewriting part of the [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) library. It’s been somewhat challenging, a little fun, and a peak into what my next 13 weeks look like. 

I had grand plans for the two weeks since I finished my pre-course work. I was going to go over more Git fundamentals, watch [Marcus Phillips’s](https://twitter.com/mracus) Udacity course on [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015), and blog like crazy! Instead, I spent time with my family, both on vacation and here at home, and even read some [comic books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flash:_Rebirth) (something I haven’t done much of since the [George H.W. Bush](http://bush41.org/) administration.) Thankfully, I was told by some of the instructors that this was in fact a great use of my time, because once this ball starts rolling . . .

. . . well, I’m imagining the [boulder scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-8AP0To4k) from Indiana Jones. It’s going to be 11-hour days, six days a week with me drinking from the firehose of coding knowledge. By the time it’s over, my rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript will transformed into an employable collection of front-end and back-end skills. 

Because Hack Reactor is headquartered in the Bay Area, my schedule will be off my two hours. Instruction will begin at 11am, and end at 10pm. This means I’ll have mornings to myself once the kids start school, and my dinner break will be used for story time and tucking in. As challenging as this will be for my family and me, it’ll be over before we know it, and I know it’ll have been worth all of the struggle.

There’s nothing left to say at this point. I’ll join a video chat and Slack channel in the morning, and the roughly 30 of us in my cohort will begin this journey together. Now I just have to outrun that boulder.
