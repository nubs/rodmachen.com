Several years ago, I got my first automatic watch. AKA a mechanical watch, this timepiece operates without batteries, using internal machinery to keep the gears turning. In other words, it’s the way watches used to be made before quartz came into the picture. 

The only downside to this type of watch (other than the fact that it gains a few seconds every day) is that is must be worn regularly to stay “charged.” After about 40 hours, the power reserve from the internal kinetic mechanism runs out and the watch stops. This has never been a problem for me. 

Before now.

Last Sunday, I put on my watch, and it took several hours to realize my wrist contained no useful date or time. I hadn’t left the house in so long that my watch stopped working.

So goes the life of the remote worker. While I’m not officially employed yet, I am working most of the day every day with the good folks at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/), learning to be a software engineer. If things work out in the future, I just might work from home; more and more developers are doing it all the time.

This coding-school experience then is my dry run for how I would pull it off. I’m only a week in, so there’s no cabin fever yet. Being in a six-days-a-week program means getting out of the house and spending time with my family on Sunday is an absolute must. In the future, that might mean leaving at night as well, at least when I don’t have to be in student mode until 10pm. But hey, that’s what meet ups are for, right? (Shout out to my [Austin JavaScript](http://austinjavascript.com/) peeps. See you in 2016!)

Taking care of my self has moved front of mind. It would be easy to eat badly while just snacking all day. My current regime has me eating a bowl of oatmeal every morning to counterbalance the ridiculous amount of coffee I’m drinking. (That’s not new; I’ve always been on the wrong side of the caffiene addiction line.) I’ve never been much of a workout guy, but I’m trying to sprinkle a little of that in. Long term, that would have to be a part of the equation.

What about screen time? Staring at an LCD is part and parcel of the game, but I’m trying to go analog when I can, whether it’s reading a real book, writing in a paper journal, or even picking on my guitar a bit. Going from my development environment of Sublime Text and iTerm to FaceBook and Twitter makes my breaks not seem much like breaks. (Never forget: Twitter is serious business.)

I’m scheduled to keep this up for three more months, and I’m sure there will be new challenges that pop up over time. For now, I’m going to keep being conscious of the fact that this is a big change, and that I need to adjust my lifestyle to meet it.

Who knows? Maybe some day going into the office will be the big change. I’m game.
