Week one is done. Hack Reactor was bound to be a trying experience, and after six days of coding and instruction, it certainly proved to be. The days were long, the material vast, and the coding was both challenging and rewarding.

What I didn’t expect was to hit any roadbumps this early. On the first timed assessment, I didn’t get enough quality work done in the allotted time. This was a real knock to my ego after having done lots of self study on JavaScript over the last year. I spent several days doing some hard looks into the metaphorical mirror.

No rest for the weary, however, and immediately I had another challenge in front of me. Our largest project of the week involved implementing several data structures. This was all new to me; I’ve never even sniffed a computer science class, in college or out. It turned out to be fantastic. The coding was a bear, and wrapping my brain around these new concepts was not easy. Finishing it was very rewarding.

To give a taste of my week, here’s an overview of the material I ingested:

**Hack Reactor specific:** Staff and Structure, Expectations, Pairing

**Software Engineering:** Recursion, Scopes/Execution Contexts/Closures, rewrite Underscore.js methods, git, instantiation patterns *(functional, functional-shared, prototypal, pseudoclassical)*, data structures *(stack, queue linked list graph tree set hash table binary search tree)*

**Introductions:** debugging, function binding, test-driven development, deployment, open-source contributions

I might have more to say about some of these in the future, but suffice it to say, my week was full, my brain is full, and tomorrow it all starts over again.

The sound you hear is me buckling up.
