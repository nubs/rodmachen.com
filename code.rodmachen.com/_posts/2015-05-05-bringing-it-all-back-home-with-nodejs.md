For the past couple of weeks I’ve been wading in the Node.js pool, trying to get my bearings. I know Node is in my future, and the experience of interacting with it after spending time on the front end has been enlightening.

My biggest takeaway from learning about Node is there is a Node.js way of doing things. It’s not like a framework that requires certain conventions in order to function properly. This is different. This is more like a religion.

What religion, you may ask? The Eternal Church of UNIX. The UNIX way turns out to be the Node way. Once I learned this, it all made sense.

See, I’ve been attracted to Node for a fairly specious reason. In my new-to-coding brain, working with files in the command line feels like “real programming.” I will be the first to admit this is crap. It is no more real than other aspects of web development that execute in the browser, for instance, but it just feels real. I think I know why.

My two formative experiences came in the 80s and 90s respectively. My family’s first computer was an Apple IIe, a pretty sweet set up with two 5.25 inch floppies and a green monochrome monitor. It booted up with a basic prompt, and while I usually played games on it ([Aztec FTW!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_%28video_game%29)), the sight of that blinking green cursor on a solid black background solidified a certain image of computing in my mind.

In college, my first exposure to the internet was via mainframe terminals. That’s how we got our email. The standard login was with VMS, but if you knew a little something, a UNIX account was possible. Using Pine and Gopher along with commands like ls felt good. (Dir for dorks!)

Fast forward to 2015, and this same UNIX informs Node.js in ways I never would have imagined. In 1993, I had no idea UNIX even had principles, much less that they would be informing software into the 21st century.

This philosophy permeates Node. The requiring of modules breaks a program down into smaller components, and text files are the medium of choice. 

I’m sure I’ll learn much more about these concepts as I proceed, but for now it’s enough that I can make my terminal window full-screen and be staring at green text on a solid black background. That’s real programming.
