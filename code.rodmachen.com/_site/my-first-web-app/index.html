    <p>Months have passed since I first started down the road of learning to code, and lots of learning has taken place. For much of it, though, it has been book learning: tutorials, lectures, or literally reading books. There’s so much to learn that a certain amount of this is inevitable, but it’s come time for me to start making things. This web app is my first step.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be fair to say I’ve made nothing over the course of the last year. This web site didn’t build itself (twice), but as far as implementing functionality using javascript fundamentals, I had not dipped my toe in that pool. In going through the interview process for a coding school, I was finally given the shove I needed to head in a more creative and practical direction.</p>

<p>After not quite cutting mustard on my first interview, I was asked to undertake a project that would show both my ability to take on something substantial and also my knowledge of functional programming in JavaScript. The challenge excited me. This was exactly what I had been looking for. The only problem was, I didn’t have a great idea for it.</p>

<p>As many have done before, I searched online first. Unsurprisingly, ideas for coding projects are all over the web. Reading these suggestions helped, but I realized quickly that I would have to go closer to home to find the right project. If I was going to spend the recommended 20-40 hours of my free time working on a project, I needed to not only see some value in it, but ideally have it come from a part of my life I’m already invested in.</p>

<p>While I have no shortage of interests and hobbies I could have incorporated, I instead look at my current line of work. I spend my days teaching English to high schoolers. (This should explain my desire for a new line of work.) EdTech is the hot new thing, and classrooms are ripe with uses for technology. I decided to throw my line into that water.</p>

<p>What I came up with was “Mr. Machen’s Essay Checker.” (<a href="http://rodmachen.com/essay-checker-beta/">rodmachen.com/essay-checker-beta</a>) The initial idea was for a word counting app, but since that functionality already exists inside every word processor, I expanded it to include specific things that I teach my students about best practices for writing an essay.</p>

<p>For instance, never use the word “essay” in an essay. This is half pet peeve, half good advice. There’s no need to say you are writing an essay; just write it. That last sentence has two more foibles. Semicolons are hard to use well, but that doesn’t stop my students. Rather than being just another conjunction, the semicolon should be used to connect two sentences in a more nuanced way. It’s not simply “and”; it’s a way of joining two sentences together to add to the meaning of each one. I also point out the use of several 1st- and 2nd- person words that have no place in a standard academic essay.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is a toy project that I probably won’t use in practice. In six weeks there will be no more teaching left for me to do. It does marry my past and present with my future and gave me a chance to explore the world of making web apps. The planning and complexity piece was especially instructive. It took several iterations to figure out how best to write my functions. Eventually, I had an “a-ha” moment in which I figured out how to break them down into smaller functions that each do one thing. From there I was able to pass them into each other, and even return functions, creating a factory for new functions.</p>

<p>I know I barely scratched the surface of what I’ll do someday with production-level web applications. This project didn’t even have a back end, but I know adding one is something I could certainly do if I put forth the same level of effort and research I did for the front end. This project might just stay in beta, but I’ve come away a better developer because of it.</p>

<p>Next step: find my next app to build.</p>
