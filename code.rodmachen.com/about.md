I am a software engineer based in Austin, Texas, specializing in web development. My primary language being JavaScript. On the back-end I work with Node.js, in addition to the Express framework and various databases.. On the front-end, I have experience with static sites comprised of HTML and CSS/Sass, as well as MVC frameworks such as AngularJS and Backbone.js.

Most of my time spent learning to code has been self directed, but I have taken courses from both Hack Reactor and MakerSquare. I've also come to appreciate the tech community by way of meetups, especially here in Austin.

My former career was as an English teacher where I specialized in the teaching of writing. I also do freelance writing on occassion, as well as photography.
